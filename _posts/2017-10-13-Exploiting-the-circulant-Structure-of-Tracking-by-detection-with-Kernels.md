**WARNING**: THIS POST IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION, WILL BE UPDATED SOON

**TIP**: Please read the [paper](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~joao/publications/henriques_eccv2012.pdf) once and use the following notes to understand the algorithm better

- In this paper the author showed how dense sampling of targets can be
incorporated to improve the performance of classifier, which was
previously trained by taking few samples around the target<sup>[1,2,3]</sup>

- While dense sampling can increase the number of samples for the
training, authors discovered how this type of sampling leads to
pattern in the samples, which they call it as **circulant structure**

- It is shown how this __circulant structure__ can take advantage of
__Fast Fourier Transform__ (__FFT__) to train the classifier in one shot
without the need to reiterate over individual samples.

- It is also shown how __circulant structure__ leads to
mathematical formulation that helps to train the classifier by
transforming the samples from input space to feature space using
kernel trick and still run faster. 

We go through the matlab code available in the
[link](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~joao/circulant/tracker_release.zip)
and understand the implementation.
