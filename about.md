I am currently working as Technical Lead in Media Analytics &
Recognition Team at [Samsung R&amp;D
Bangalore](http://www.samsung.com/in/aboutsamsung/samsungelectronics/india/rnd.html).
I completed my Master's degree in Signal Processing, from [Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore](http://ece.iisc.ernet.in/).  

My current interest is on applying Deep Learning for computer vision problems such as Scene Understanding, Object Detection,  Recognition and Segmentation. I am currently working on Semantic Image Segmentation problem.

My broad interests are Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Machine learning, Deep Learning and to apply these technologies to solve real world problems.

Learning is a constant process. Listed below some of the courses
which I am doing / have done and benefitted from:

- [Learning from Data, Abu Mostafa](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD63A284B7615313A)
