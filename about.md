I am currently working as Technical Lead in Media Analytics &
Recognition Team at [Samsung R&amp;D
Bangalore](http://www.samsung.com/in/aboutsamsung/samsungelectronics/india/rnd.html).
I completed my Master's degree in Signal Processing, from [Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore](http://ece.iisc.ernet.in/).  

My current interest is on applying Deep Learning for scene understanding which includes scene classification, detection, recognition and segmentation. 

I am fascinated by how deep learning models have reached human accuracy in these tasks.
I am very enthusiatic towards reverse engineering these deep networks to understand what each layers in the network have learnt.
I am currently working on Semantic Image Segmentation problem.
